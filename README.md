# gdiPipeline
## IN DEVELOPMENT

R package to run GDI species delimitation analyses using BPP

Tested with BPP v.4.1.4

To download and install this package
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("dmacguigan/gdiPipeline")
library(gdiPipeline)
```

Example script
```
# GDI pileine with Percina kusha example data
# https://github.com/dmacguigan/gdiPipeline/tree/master/example

library(gdiPipeline)

###### PIPELINE PARAMETERS ######

## general parameters

wd="./gdiPipeline/example"
plotColors = c(brewer.pal(12, "Paired"), "black") # for later plots of GDI
nLoci = 10
threads = 8
nreps = 4

## input files

# maximally split guide tree
# newick format, include semicolon after tree
treefile="Pkus.tree" 

# list of prior combinations
# one line per set of priors
# each line should contain: tau_alpha tau_beta theta_alpha theta_beta
priors="priors.txt" 

## BPP-specific input files
## see the BPP user manual for details on how each file should be formatted
## https://github.com/bpp/bpp

map="Pkus.Imap.txt" 
heredity = "heredity.txt"
loci = "m100p_10loci.phy"

# name for BPP template control file, this will be created in step 1
ctl = "ctlTemplate.ctl"

###### PIPELINE STEPS ######

# STEP 1
# create BPP control file template for bppInputs function
BPPCtlTemplate(wd)

# STEP 2
# using a text editor, modify burnin, samplefreq, or nsample parameters in the ctlTemplate.ctl file if necessary before proceeding
# may also want to specify finetune values based on preliminary runs if mixing/convergence is an issue

# STEP 3
# create directories and files for BPP runs
# specify priors and maximally split tree
bppInputs(wd, treefile, map,
          priors,
          heredity, loci,
          ctl, nLoci,
          threads, nreps)

# STEP 4
# create task file, each line with a different command to run BPP
bppTaskFile(wd)

# STEP 5
# run the task file generated by bppTaskFile
# ideally parallelize using a job array setup (e.g. https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/dsq/)

# STEP 6
# assess mixing and convergence of BPP analyses
# diagnostic files are written in each model directory
# this may take a while to run depending on the number of analyses and the MCMC chain lengths
checkConvergence(wd=wd, nreps=nreps)

# STEP 7
# summarize the bpp results
# caluclate GDI
# plot GDI for each replicate run and binning replicate runs
gdi <- bppSummarizeGDI(wd, plotColors, nreps)

# plot GDI estimates for all species in one figure
plotByPrior(gdi, wd, nreps, priors, plotWidth=8, plotHeight=5)
