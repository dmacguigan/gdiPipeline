install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("dmacguigan/gdiPipeline")
library(gdiPipeline)
```

# test gdi pileine with P. kusha data [NEED TO REPLACE WITH EXAMPLE DATA]

library(gdiPipeline)

# pipeline parameters

wd="G:/NearLab/Pkus/analyses/BPP/m100p_BPPSetup"
treefile="Pkus.tree" # make sure newick tree has semicolon at the line end
map="Pkus.Imap.txt"
priors="priors.txt"
heredity = "heredity.txt"
loci = "m100p_loci.phy"
ctl = "ctlTemplate.ctl"

# pipeline steps

# STEP 1
# create BPP control file template for bppInputs function
BPPCtlTemplate(wd)

# STEP 2
# modify burnin, samplefreq, or nsample parameters in the ctlTemplate.ctl file if necessary before proceeding
# may also want to specify finetune values based on preliminary runs if mixing/convergence is an issue

# STEP 3
# create directories and files for BPP runs
# specify priors (txt file, each line with a specific combination)
# specify maximally split tree
bppInputs(wd, treefile, map,
          priors,
          heredity, loci,
          ctl, nLoci,
          threads, nreps)

# STEP 4
# create task file, each line with a different command to run BPP
# use this task file in conjunction with job array on computing cluster (e.g. https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/dsq/)
bppTaskFile(wd)

# STEP 5
# run the task file generated by bppTaskFile
# ideally parallelize using a job array setup (e.g. https://docs.ycrc.yale.edu/clusters-at-yale/job-scheduling/dsq/)

# STEP 6
# assess mixing and convergence of BPP analyses
# diagnostic files are written in each model directory
# this may take a while to run depending on the number of analyses and the MCMC chain lengths
checkConvergence(wd=wd, nreps=nreps)

# STEP 7
# summarize the bpp results
# caluclate GDI
# plot GDI for each replicate run and binning replicate runs
gdi <- bppSummarizeGDI(wd, plotColors, nreps)

# plot GDI estimates for all species in one figure
plotByPrior(gdi, wd, nreps, priors, plotWidth=8, plotHeight=5)
